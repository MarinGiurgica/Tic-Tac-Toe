pip install pyinstaller
cd Desktop
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icontictactoe.ico tictactoe.py
#using command prompt
#--onefile because we only want one executable
#--windowed because we don`t want a console to be opened
#icontictactoe.ico is our desired icon for the final executable, which must be in the same location as the tictactoe.py is, and it must be in an ico/exe format
