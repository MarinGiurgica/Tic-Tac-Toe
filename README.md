Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a small Python game resembling the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

It was built in Python and the GUI was done using the <Tkinter> module. The whole code is written in a simple manner which makes it easy to understand and read even for somebody who has never coded before.

Enough with the talking, go on and look at my small interactive game:)
